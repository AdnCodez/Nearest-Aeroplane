# Nearest-Aeroplane
**T**his Python challenge, help us to find the closest airborne aeroplane to any given position.
We'll be using OpenSky's Network API which will give us the data on all currently airborne commercial aeroplanes in a JSON format.
And then we can find the positions of all the planes and compare them to our given position (Latitude/Logtitude).
